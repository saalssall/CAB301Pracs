# Week 02

## Characteristics of an Algorithm

An algorithm must have:

- **Input** — receives well-defined data
- **Output** — produces a specific result
- **Definiteness** — each step is unambiguous
- **Finiteness** — terminates after finite steps

---

## Big-O Notation

Big-O classifies how algorithms scale as input size increases.

---

## Search Algorithms

### Linear Search
- Brute force search
- Checks each item one by one
- Worst case: `O(n)`

### Binary Search
- More efficient than linear search
- Requires sorted arrays
- Splits data in half repeatedly
- Complexity: `O(log n)`

---

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
- Compares every pair
- Complexity: `O(n²)`

### Merge Sort
- Divide and conquer
- Complexity: `O(n log n)`

### Quick Sort
- Efficient partitioning algorithm

---

## Pseudocode

- Language independent
- Easier to communicate
- Focuses on logic instead of syntax

---

## NP-Complete Problems

NP-complete = **Nondeterministic Polynomial Complete**

---

## Data Structures

### Array
- Fast index access
- Access: `O(1)`

### Linked List
- Fast insertion: `O(1)`
- Slower index access

### Binary Search Tree
- Combines ideas of arrays and linked lists
- Efficient searching

### Hash Table

---

## Stack (LIFO)

**Last In, First Out**

Applications:

## Queue (FIFO)

**First In, First Out**

Applications:

---

## Recursion

### Recursive
- Function calls itself

# Week 03

## Algorithm Complexity Analysis

Goal:
- Understand how input size `n` scales

### Input Size Examples

| Structure | Input Size |
|---|---|
| Array | Number of elements |
| String | Length |
| Graph | Vertices |
| Integer | Number of bits |

---

## Why Count Steps Instead of Seconds?

Because:
- CPU speeds vary
- Compiler optimizations differ
- Background processes affect timing

We need machine-independent measurements.

---

## Loop Analysis

### Single Loop
If runtime depends on `n`, growth scales with `n`.

### Binary Search
Example of logarithmic growth.

### Constant Growth
Execution time stays the same as input increases.

### Cubic Growth
Execution time increases rapidly as input grows.

---

## Complexity Cases

### Best Case
Minimum operations required.

### Worst Case
Maximum operations required.

Used for reliability analysis.

### Average Case
Expected operations for typical input.

---

## Linear Search Analysis

| Case | Comparisons |
|---|---|
| Best | 1 |
| Worst | n |

---

## Big-O Rules

- Keep dominant term only
- Ignore constants and lower-order terms
- Provides upper runtime bound

Example:

$begin:math:display$
3n \\rightarrow O\(n\)
$end:math:display$

---

## Binary Tree
Used in binary search structures.

## Hash Index
Allows direct lookup.

---

## Social Media Feed Example

### Naïve Approach
- Sort all posts
- `O(n \log n)`

### Optimised Approach
- Sort top `k` candidates
- `O(k \log k)`

Pre-filtering reduces work.

---

## Empirical vs Theoretical Analysis

### Empirical
- Measure real performance
- Count operations

### Theoretical
- Mathematical analysis using Big-O

Usually:
1. Theoretical first
2. Empirical second

Large inputs better reveal scalability differences.

# Week 04 — Linear Data Structures

## Choosing Data Structures

Important factors:
- Memory efficiency
- Access speed
- Modification speed

---

## Arrays

- Cache-friendly
- Fast access
- Slow modification due to shifting
- Shifting complexity: `O(n)`

---

## Linked Lists

- Nodes scattered in memory
- Connected using pointers
- Dynamic size

---

## Arrays vs Linked Lists

| Feature | Better Choice |
|---|---|
| Cache performance | Arrays |
| Insertion flexibility | Linked Lists |
| Memory efficiency | Arrays |
| Modification flexibility | Linked Lists |

Choose based on access vs modification needs.

---

## Stack

**LIFO — Last In, First Out**

- Operations: `O(1)`
- Only top element accessible

---

## Queue

### Operations
- Enqueue → add to rear
- Dequeue → remove from front

### Characteristics
- First come, first served
- Prevents unfair cutting in line
- Operations: `O(1)`

### Applications
- Printer queues
- Task scheduling

---

## Circular Queue

Rear wraps around when space becomes available.

---

## Hash Tables

- Key-value storage
- Uses computed indices

### Hash Function

$begin:math:display$
\\text\{Key\} \\rightarrow \\text\{Array Index\}
$end:math:display$

### Advantages
- Trades space for speed
- Average lookup: `O(1)`
- Faster than `O(n)` searching

### Good Hash Functions
- Distribute keys evenly
- Prevent collisions and clustering

---

## Collisions

Occurs when two keys hash to the same index.

### Linear Probing
Checks next available slot sequentially.

### Example

$begin:math:display$
\\text\{student\\\_id\} \\rightarrow \\text\{record location\}
$end:math:display$

---

## Load Factor

$begin:math:display$
\\text\{Load Factor\} \= \\frac\{\\text\{elements\}\}\{\\text\{table size\}\}
$end:math:display$

### Low Load (< 0.7)
- Few collisions
- Faster

### High Load (> 0.9)
- More collisions
- Slower

---

## Queue Implementation Guidance

Track:
- Front index
- Rear index
- Enqueue/dequeue operations
- Circular behaviour

---

## Stack Implementation Guidance

### Array-Based Stack
Uses arrays for stack operations.

---

## Quick Sort

### Partitioning
Elements left of pivot do not need full ordering initially.

### Choosing a Pivot
1. Identify first, middle, and last elements
2. Sort the 3 elements
3. Hide pivot before partitioning

# Week 06

## Big-O Complexity

- When evaluating Big-O complexity, always analyse the **worst-case scenario**

- Worst-case analysis shows how an algorithm behaves under the hardest conditions

---

## Quick Sort

### Pivot Choice

- Pivot selection determines the performance of quicksort

- Good pivot choices improve efficiency

- Poor pivot choices can reduce performance significantly

---

## Stable Algorithms

A stable algorithm:

- Does not reorder duplicate values

---

## Merge Sort

### Characteristics

- Stable sorting algorithm

- Requires additional memory

---

## Randomized Algorithms

### Purpose

- Help avoid bad behaviour

- Reduce chances of poor worst-case performance

---

# Week 08 — Dynamic Programming

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is the process of optimizing recursive problems that contain overlapping subproblems.

---

## Subproblems

A subproblem occurs when a larger problem is solved using smaller versions of the same problem.

---

## Overlapping Subproblems

Overlapping subproblems occur when recursive calls repeatedly solve the same smaller problems.

### Fibonacci Example

In Fibonacci recursion:

- `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)` repeatedly call many of the same functions

This repeated work creates overlapping subproblems.

---

## Solving Overlapping Subproblems

One major technique is **memoization**.

---

## 1. Memoization

### Purpose

- Reduces recursive calls

- Avoids recomputing previously solved problems

### Method

- Store computed results in a hash table

- Reuse stored values later

### Implementation

- Pass the hash table as a second parameter to recursive functions

---

## 2. Bottom-Up Approach

### Idea

Instead of recursion:

- Use loops or iteration

- Solve smaller problems first and build upward

---

# Sunday Algorithm

## Key Ideas

- `j` represents what we are searching for

- Initial move is:

$begin:math:display$

j \+ 1

$end:math:display$

- Movement depends on:

$begin:math:display$

j \- i

$end:math:display$

- The algorithm uses a dictionary for comparisons

---

## Process

1. Compare the first character

2. Compare the last character

3. Check whether the character exists in the dictionary

4. Subtract its index from `j` to determine movement

---

## Characteristics

- Very efficient string searching algorithm
